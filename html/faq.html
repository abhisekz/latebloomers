                    <dt>What are the physical signs of abuse or addiction?</dt>
                    <dd>The physical signs of abuse or addiction can vary depending on the person and the drug being abused. For example, someone who abuses marijuana may have a chronic cough or worsening of asthmatic symptoms. Each drug has short-term and long-term physical effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase heart rate and blood pressure, whereas opioids like heroin may slow the heart rate and reduce respiration.</dd>
                
                    <dt>What is drug addiction?</dt>
                    <dd>Drug addiction is a complex, and often chronic, brain disease. It is characterized by drug craving, seeking, and use that can persist even in the face of devastating life consequences. Addiction results largely from brain changes that stem from prolonged drug use—changes that involve multiple brain circuits, including those responsible for governing self-control and other behaviors. Drug addiction is treatable, often with medications (for some addictions) combined with behavioral therapies. However, relapse is common and can happen even after long periods of abstinence, underscoring the need for long-term support and care. Relapse does not signify treatment failure, but rather should prompt treatment re-engagement or modification. For more information, see <a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugs-brains-behavior-science-addiction/preface" rel="nofollow">"Drugs, Brains, and Behavior - The Science of Addiction."</a></dd>
                    
                    <dt>Are there effective treatments for drug addiction?</dt>
                    <dd>Drug addiction can be effectively treated with behavioral therapies and, for addiction to some drugs such as heroin, nicotine, or alcohol, medications. Treatment will vary for each person depending on the type of drug(s) being used. Multiple courses of treatment may be needed to achieve success. Research has revealed 13 basic principles that underlie effective drug addiction treatment discussed in <a href="http://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/principles-drug-addiction-treatment-research-based-guide-third-edition/acknowledgments">Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment: A Research-Based Guide.</a></dd>
                
                    <dt>What is detoxification, or "detox"?</dt>
                    <dd>Detoxification is the process of allowing the body to rid itself of a drug while managing the symptoms of withdrawal. It is often the first step in a drug treatment program and should be followed by treatment with a behavioral-based therapy and/or a medication, if available. Detox alone with no follow-up is not treatment.</dd>
                
                    <dt>What is withdrawal? How long does it last?</dt>
                    <dd> Withdrawal describes the various symptoms that occur after long-term use of a drug is reduced or stopped abruptly. Length of withdrawal and symptoms vary with the type of drug. For example, physical symptoms of heroin withdrawal may include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, insomnia, diarrhea, vomiting, and cold flashes. These physical symptoms may last for several days, but the general depression, or dysphoria (opposite of euphoria), that often accompanies heroin withdrawal may last for weeks. In many cases, withdrawal can be easily treated with medications to ease the symptoms, but treating withdrawal is not the same as treating addiction.</dd>
                
                    <dt>How Long Does Rehab Take?</dt>
                    <dd>There isn't a set period of time that applies to everyone when it comes to rehabilitation. Some addicts may need a 90-day stay at an inpatient treatment facility to truly find their path in recovery, whereas others may only need a 30-day program. It simply varies according to the addiction in question, the individual's history with addiction, dual diagnosis conditions, and the individual's specific physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs. <br>
                
                    Studies find that those who spend longer amounts of time in rehabilitation programs achieve better rates of long-term sobriety. This is because more time spend at a treatment facility means more opportunity to focus on the root causes behind the addiction. If these issues are effectively addressed, the individual is more likely to be able to resist temptations to relapse.<br>
                
                    Drug and alcohol addiction treatment doesn't conclude after the patient exits the rehabilitation program, regardless of its duration. Recovery is an ongoing process that will continue for the rest of the patient's life. Long-term recovery often involves ongoing therapy, both in individual and group form, and attendance at 12-step meetings. Some patients find other activities key to their ongoing recovery, such as meditation, yoga, exercise or art.<br>
                
                    It's important to note that many addicts don't achieve perfect, lifelong recovery with one rehab stay. Relapse should not be viewed as a failure; instead, it should be seen as an obstacle to overcome on one's lifelong journey to sobriety. Relapse is an opportunity to reassess one's path and get back into a program that offers the support and help needed to maintain sobriety. Many addicts complete more than one stay in rehab before they are able to find their footing in their recovery journey.</dd>
                
                    <dt>How Much Does Rehab Cost?</dt>
                    <dd>
                        The cost of treatment of addiction rehabilitation programs can range dramatically. The cost is dependent on a variety of things, such as whether the rehab is an inpatient or outpatient facility, if the program provides certain amenities, and what the program provides as far as detoxification and rehabilitation services.
                
                        <div>
                            <strong>Cost of Rehab vs. Cost of Addiction:</strong> While the cost of rehab may be a deterrent for some people, it's important to remember the cost of addiction. It comes with many financial costs, due to the price of the drugs, lost productivity at work, criminal fines and medical bills for health issues associated with addiction. In addition, addiction costs the addict dearly in other ways -- from the deterioration of relationships and lost career goals to overall unhappiness and poor health.
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>
                            There are three things that will affect the cost of rehab programs. These include:
                        </h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Amenities provided</li>
                            <li>Length of the program</li>
                            <li>Type of program</li>
                        </ul>
                
                        The amenities of a program can include anything from animal therapy to professional chefs. High-end programs offer more alternative therapies that can aid the recovery process, such as acupuncture, massage therapy and yoga classes. Luxury programs are also more likely to offer patients private rooms whereas rooms are generally shared in low-cost options. <br>
                        The length of the program also affects its overall cost. A short program could last for two weeks to 30 days, so it would cost less than a program that lasts 90-days or even six months. The cost of a program is determined primarily by the length of stay, so it's important to take this into consideration. During your intake session, a counselor will discuss the amount of time they recommend you stay in the program for the best shot at recovery. <br>
                        Finally, look at the type of program you are entering. Inpatient programs will cost more than outpatient programs because they require patients to live at the facility and have medical care available during all hours of operation. You may ask us what amenities are included, since some programs charge extra for certain activities.
                    </dd>
                    
                    <dt>Which Is Better -- Inpatient or Outpatient (Day Care/Half Way Home) Rehab?</dt>
                    <dd>Inpatient facilities differ from outpatient facilities in a number of ways, from costs involved and intensity of treatment to the overall environment throughout the recovery process. <br>
                        Inpatient facilities are 24-hour facilities that usually have medical staff members present at all times. These facilities allow patients to live there, and they provide medical support whenever necessary. Inpatient programs include group therapy, individual therapy and often complementary therapies, such as meditation, animal therapy or outdoor activities. Inpatient treatment is the most comprehensive form of treatment, allowing the patient to fully focus on their addiction and recovery. Since they are removed from the stress of their regular lives, patients are better able to attack their addiction issues. Inpatient facilities often cost more because the patient is provided with everything -- therapy, meals, lodging and activities. <br>
                        Outpatient facilities allow a patient to come for treatment, therapy and other services, but then leave at the end of the treatment sessions. This lets a person have a normal work, school or home life while seeking treatment. Outpatient programs vary; some involve all-day sessions whereas others may only treat patients for an hour or two per day. Outpatient care generally costs less because there are fewer amenities and fewer staff hours involved in direct care. And that is why the inpatient treatment is much more expensive in comparison. <br>
                        Inpatient rehab is recommended for those with long-standing addictions, addictions to multiple substances, and dual diagnosis conditions. It is also advised for those who have had previous rehab stays and then relapsed. Outpatient rehabilitation is best for those with short-term addictions.</dd>
                
                    <dt>I have already been to other rehabs and relapsed, how will it help?</dt>
                    <dd>Relapse is also a choice. <br>
                        There could be many reasons for a relapse- maybe the person was treated against their wishes, or did not follow up. Some find a life away from addiction in a flow, and some take time. It is very relative. <br>
                        If a rock cracks on the 14th stroke, it does not mean that the first 13 strokes were wasted.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Many people relapse, so does drug &amp; alcohol rehabilitation actually work?</dt>
                    <dd>Like every other medical treatment, addiction treatment cannot guarantee lifelong recovery. Relapse is often a part of the recovery process; it is always possible–and treatable</dd>
                    
                    <dt>After years of being so dishonest and manipulative, can an addicted person ever go back to the way he/she was before?</dt>
                    <dd>As a person works their way through the Life Skills portion of the Late Bloomers drug rehab program, <strong>he/she will go through a series of courses that help him/her recover his/her own basic honesty. He/she will learn how personal integrity is lost and how he/she can recover it again</strong>. He/she then uses this knowledge to confront the harm he/she has done in the past. Many people talk about a "weight being lifted" from their shoulders as they complete this step. This frees them to learn how to be more successful when dealing with life situations, becoming able to turn an adverse situation into a good one. This skill means that each person learns that he/she does not have to escape from problems; he/she can fix them. Finally, the person in recovery studies and applies The Way to Happiness, a non-denominational moral code. Here he/she learns twenty-one guidelines for living a moral, happy life. These steps, all together, help a person leave that manipulative personality far behind and return to the loving person they were before the drugs took control.</dd>
                    
                    <dt>An addicted person seems so out of touch with reality. Can this be repaired?</dt>
                    <dd><strong>There are several tools a person learns on the Late Bloomers drug and alcohol rehabilitation program that enable him to improve his perception and communication</strong>. First, there is a series of communication skills that are done right at the beginning of the rehab program that begin to put a person back into control of himself, his emotions and his/her communication. After the <strong>thorough drug detoxification</strong> step, these skills are then practiced to a higher level of expertise. Then a series of exercises are done that help each person sharpen their perceptions of the real world, not the dim scene they viewed when affected by drugs. The sum of all these actions is a person who is definitely far more in touch with reality!</dd>
                
                    <dt>Will my loved one be an addict for the rest of his/her life?</dt>
                    <dd><strong>No, a person really can recover from addiction</strong>. The Late Bloomers drug rehab program has a comprehensive approach to addiction recovery. The guilt, cravings and depression that keep a person locked in addiction are thoroughly addressed on this program. When a person graduates from this program, he/she can consider himself recovered provided he/she use what he/she has learned in daily life to maintain a healthy, sober life. By doing this, he/she may never again feel the need to use drugs or alcohol again.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Is Insurance Accepted?</dt>
                    <dd>Generally in India, the addiction is not covered under insurance but you can ask the concerned insurance company whether such facility is covered.</dd>
