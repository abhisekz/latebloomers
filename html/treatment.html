                    <h2>Drug / Alcohol Addiction (Chemical Dependency)</h2>    
                    <p>
                        Addiction is a state of periodic or chronic intoxication produced by the repeated consumption of a drug (natural or synthetic). Its characteristics include: (i) an overpowering desire or need (compulsion) to continue taking the drug and to obtain it by any means; (ii) a tendency to increase the dose; (iii) a psychic (psychological) and generally a physical dependence on the effects of the drug; and (iv) detrimental effects on the individual and on society. <br>
                        Alcohol and drug addictions are typically diagnosed using the criteria for substance dependence. There are seven criteria for substance dependence. To be diagnosed, the person would have to have at least three of the criteria within the same year. <br>
                        The first two criteria, tolerance and withdrawal, are central to “physiological dependence” on a drug. A person can be diagnosed with substance dependence either with or without the “physiological dependence,” although a person is at greater risk of medical problems and relapse if he does not have “physiological dependence.” <br>
                   </p>
                    <section>
                        <h3>The seven criteria for substance dependence are:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>(1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following:

                                    <li>(a) A need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect.</li>
                                    <li>(b) Markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance.</li>

                                    <li>(a) The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance (refer to Criteria A or B of the criteria sets for Withdrawal from specific substances).</li>
                                    <li>(b) The same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>(3) The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended.</li>
                            <li>(4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use.</li>
                            <li>(5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance (such as visiting multiple doctors or driving long distances), use the substance (such as chain smoking) or recover from its effects.</li>
                            <li>(6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use.</li>
                            <li>(7) The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance.</li>

                        <h3>Phases in alcoholism/Drug Addiction</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are three Distinctly Noticeable Phases in alcoholism/Drug Addiction. Each phase has its Signs and Symptoms.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Early Phase</li>
                            <li>The Middle Phase</li>
                            <li>The Chronic Phase</li>
                        </ul>
                        <section>
                            <h4>The Early Phase</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Increased Tolerance:</h5>
                                    <p>This is the first warning sign of the development of alcoholism/addiction. The same Pleasurable feeling obtained earlier with one or two drinks /uses is not reached with the same quantity of usage .More of the substance is needed to get the same feeling. Eg. A patient told me “I started drinking at home and realized I needed more alcohol to get the same high as earlier”</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Blackouts:</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        This is not going unconscious or falling flat. During a black out, one may go through many activities like walking, talking, even driving a vehicle ‘apparently normally’, but have NO recollection of them afterwards.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Preoccupation with Drinking/Using:</h5>
                                    <p>
                                       Even when one is not drinking/using, one makes plans about how to obtain the next fix or drink and one can be completely preoccupied by these thoughts. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Avoiding Any Talk About Alcohol/Drugs:</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Despite the preoccupation, person feels totally under control and does not feel the need to share or talk about this craving with anybody. Even if one has boasted earlier of one’s capacity to drink/drug, one wants to avoid the subject now.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
                        <section>
                            <h4>The Middle Phase</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Loss of control:</h5>
                                    <p>Initially, there is a loss of control over the amount of alcohol/drug consumed. Later on, one starts drinking beyond the necessary consumption and gets drunk at inappropriate places like at parties, weddings etc. thus losing control over the time, place and occasion of drinking/using .</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Justifying drinking / using:</h5>
                                    <p>Remorse arises as a result of irresponsible consumption and resultant behavioural embarrassments. The drinking/using is justified citing various reasons as varied as wife fought with me to unhappy married life to stressful job to pressure of friends to money problems etc. In an attempt to stave the feeling of guilt, different reasons are given ,but the drinking/using continues.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Grandios Behaviour:</h5>
                                    <p>The afflicted person starts talking big and spending big more than one can afford. Quite often, alcoholics/addicts in this phase do not provide even basic needs for the dependent family, but spend what little they have in extravagant gestures among friends. Deals are signed, properties written off marriages done under the influence of substance. Eg. The first marriage of famous pop star Britney Spears was done in a drunken stupor. A person in my neighborhood wrote off a major portion of his property for a pittance under the influence of alcohol.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Temporary Abstinence:</h5>
                                    <p>By this time, the drinking/using has lead to plenty of problems, at home and in the office due to recurrent absenteeism. One is at the point of losing one’s job and perhaps one’s marriage. This might make the person abstain for a while just toquieting things at home and to calm the bosses.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>Changing the pattern</h5>
                                    <p>Some make a change in the pattern of drinking/using. They try to change what they drink/using; arrack to brandy, whiskey to beer. They try a change of place or time. The addictive logic takes over here wherein they believe that the problem they are facing is due to the current brand of substance used. E.g. A person said he felt he faced a problem because he drank only beer. He was certain he had no alcohol problem. He felt half a case of beer daily was consuming too much fluid so he switched to scotch and soda when his symptoms got worse he switched to whiskey and water; as his symptoms increased further, he eliminated “water”. This is the nature of Addictive Logic. But so long as it is alcohol/drugs, no matter how many changes are made, they continue to be immersed in the same problems that haunted them before.</p>

                        <section>
                            <h4>The Chronic phase</h4>
                            <p>This phase is characterized by noticeable physical, mental and social deterioration. There is a total breakdown in relationship with the family.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>o   Binge Drinking/Insane Drug using:</h5>
                                    <p>The person drinks/uses continuously for days together, does not eat and does not involve oneself in any other activity. At the end of each binge one are left shaken, frightened and guilt-ridden; one promise never to drink/use again. Soon enough one go on another binge.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>o   Ethical Breakdown :</h5>
                                    <p>The addict borrows, lies and even steals to keep liquor/drug in supply. The person has no qualms about being unethical. The sole aim is to get enough to drink/drug whatever the means. E.g. A patient would tell his neighbor he needs money to pay the person who has brought the cooking gas.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>o   Paranoia and Hallucinations:</h5>
                                    <p>The addict begins to suspect people around with little reason. Getting paranoid that all his wealth will be robbed. He imagines they are plotting against him. One may imagine voices speaking to. He may see things that do not exist or may feel things crawling on you. E. g. A patient I came across after long term consumption began feeling that if a small group of people unknown to him gather near him then they are definitely talking about him.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <h5>o   Lack of Motor Co-Ordination:</h5>
                                    <p>The next day morning it feels like a sledgehammer in the head-hangover and one feels miserable, the body shaking,the hand trembles as one holds the coffee mug. To feel “ normal” one has to down a few drinks or use drugs. The drink or drug that made one feel better and enhanced a normal state of being now made one feel only pain and the ‘choice’ to use is taken away and ‘compulsion’ and ‘need’ to use to avoid pain takes over.<br>
                                    Just as motor coordination is affected all other bodily systems are slowly and steadily affected with continued use of the substance from the liver, GIT, Renal system, reproductive system, brain everything eventually lose their normal functionality and get damaged. Mood swings result, control over rationalized ways of behaving are lost due to the substance.This is the end of the road. Those who do not stop alcohol/drugs consumption even at this stage get mentally ill or die a slow, painful death.

                    <p>
                        Our addiction treatment centre program is very Patient Specific, tailored as per what is required for each patient individually. Confidentiality and anonymity of the patient is maintained at an optimum level with us.<br>
                        We provide the patient [both male and female] an informal ambience in a controlled environment conducive to effective recovery.<br>
                        The treatment of the family is as essential as that of the one addicted, as, while the addict tries to control his usage, the family also tries to control the addict’s usage, in the bargain losing their identity and sense of self. This is called <strong>Co-dependency</strong>.

                        <section>
                            <h4>Detoxification</h4>
                            <p>
                                The treatment starts with Detoxification, under the medical supervision, which is separate from the main rehab for treatment program. During detoxification, the substance is stopped and medication is given at this time to ensure smooth tiding over of the withdrawals. During this time or at the time of admission, a case history is taken from the Patient. Blood investigations are also done to evaluate the physical status of the patient. Psychometric evaluation of the patient, if necessary, is also done by a qualified clinical  Psychologist / social worker. <br>
                                Duration of the treatment program which is usually of 45 to 90 days is decided upon during the detoxification phase.

                            <h4>Counseling</h4>
                            <p>
                                Counseling is done on individual, group or family basis .The psychologists have a total experience of around 15 years in the field of treatment of those affected and afflicted by Addiction. A process of counseling, meditation, yoga, group therapies, and input sessions enables a patient to evolve into a spiritual awakening no more in the need of a substance or in need to use alcohol/ drugs. We guide a patient through his Low self esteem, Improper Coping skills Fears, Resentments, Sexuality issues, and numerous character defects besides addictive behavior and thinking.

                        <section>
                            <h4>Other alternative techniques</h4>
                            <p>
                                Many techniques have been incorporated into the treatment program. These have been essentially designed to be psychotherapeutic. These techniques aid in bringing to the fore all suppressed and repressed emotions and experiences, which are then dealt with through the counseling process.
                                Substance/chemical dependency creates a neurochemical path in the brain – primarily the dopamine pathway, which is triggered and reinforced by repetitive usage. By reinforcing hobby building process in the Patient, the said neurochemical pathway is regenerated in the brain which provides a more effective and constructive long lasting feeling of well being through the release of endorphins. It has been our observation that the afore said techniques, enables the person to effectively handle the problem of addiction.
